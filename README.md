This repository contains two simple Python programs that perform basic mathematical operations and create a personalized greeting message.

Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations

Problem Statement: Write a Python program that does the following:
1.  Takes two numbers as input from the user.
2.  Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:
o	Addition
o	Subtraction
o	Multiplication
o	Division
3.  Displays the results of each operation on the screen.
   
 Expected Output:
The output should include the result of each operation performed, for example:
```
Enter first number: 5
Enter second number: 10
Addition: 15
Subtraction: -5
Multiplication: 50
Division: 0.5
```

Task 2: Create a Personalized Greeting

Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
1.  Takes a user's first name and last name as input.
2.  Concatenates the first name and last name into a full name.
3.  Prints a personalized greeting message using the full name.

Expected Output:
The program should output a greeting like:
```
Enter your first name: John
Enter your last name: Doe
Hello, John Doe! Welcome to the Python program.
```
